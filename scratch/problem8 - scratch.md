The equality of sets
```latex
\[
	A \cartprod (B \relcmplmnt C) = (A \cartprod B) \relcmplmnt (A \cartprod C) 
\]
```
is generally true. Write a formal proof of the equality using the Test for Set Equality

## Scratch solution
### Forward case
Suppose x ∈ A ⨯ (B / C), st. x = (a,b) for some a = A, b = (B / C). Let's prove that this set is a subset of the set on RH
