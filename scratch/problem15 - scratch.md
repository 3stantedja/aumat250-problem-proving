## Statement 1
Statement is "A graph is maximal if it has exactly two connected components".
Try contrapositive : "When a graph has less than or more than two connected components, then it's not maximal"
- Case 1: graph has < 2 connected components.
    - Graph w/ 0 components
        - no vertex nor edges
        - empty graph
        - adding one point creates a subgraph (n = 0 is now a "subgraph"?)
            - connected, is component (from where?)
                - no other larger subgraph containing that point but itself
            - therefore loses non-connectivity, and n vertex > 0
                - it's simple though (n-1)
                - not a maximal graph
    - graph w/ 1 component
        - has n vertex, n-1 edges
        -
- Case 2: graph has > 2 connected components.
