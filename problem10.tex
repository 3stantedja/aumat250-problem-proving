    \begin{problem}
        Suppose \(A\) is a set that definitely does not contain any cats, and let \[\funcdef{f}{\powset{A}}{\powset{A \union \{\text{Grumpy Cat}\}}}\] represent the function defined by \[f(X) = X \union \{\text{Grumpy Cat}\}.\]
        \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
        	\item Verify that \(f\) is injective.
        	\item Verify that \(f\) is not surjective.
        	\item Describe specifically how to \emph{restrict the codomain} of \(f\) to make it bijective.
        	\item Describe the input-output rule for \(\inv{f}\), the inverse function of the bijective version of \(f\) from (c).
        \end{enumerate}
