    \begin{problem}
        For a maximal graph \(G\), prove that such a graph must:
        \begin{enumerate}[1.]
            \item have exactly two connected components, and
            \item each connected components must be a complete graph.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{problem}
    
    \begin{answer}
        As suggested by the assignment, let's prove each of the statements seperately. For each statements, we're going to try proving it by the contrapositive or by contradiction.

        For statement 1, the contrapositive of it would be:
        \begin{contrapositive}
            If a graph has more or less than two connected components, then it is not a maximal graph.
        \end{contrapositive}
    \end{answer}
