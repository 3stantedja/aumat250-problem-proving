    \begin{problem}
        For a maximal graph \(G\), prove that such a graph must:
        \begin{enumerate}[1.]
            \item have exactly two connected components, and
            \item each connected components must be a complete graph.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{problem}
    
    \begin{answer}
        As suggested by the assignment, let's prove each of the statements seperately. For each statements, we're going to try proving it by the contrapositive or by contradiction.
